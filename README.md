index.html       # Main HTML file
(style inside index.html)   # Internal CSS for styling

```

## üõ† How to Run Locally

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc).

No additional setup is required.

## üìß Contact Form Setup

This project uses **Formspree** to handle the contact form:

- The form is already connected to Formspree with the action URL:
  ```
  https://formspree.io/f/xanonogk
  ```
- When a user submits the form, the data is sent to the associated email address.

**Note:**  
Make sure your Formspree project is correctly set up and verified. Otherwise, the form submission won't trigger email delivery.

If you want to use your own email:
1. Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io).
2. Create an account.
3. Set up a new form.
4. Replace the form `action` URL in `index.html` with your new form link.

## üì± Responsiveness

The website is fully responsive:
- Desktop (Large Screens)
- Tablet
- Mobile Phones

CSS Flexbox and Grid, combined with media queries, are used to ensure a seamless experience across devices.

## ‚ú® Future Improvements

- Add a backend server (Node.js, Flask, PHP) for enhanced control over form submissions.
- Add CAPTCHA verification for the contact form to prevent spam.
- Deploy the site on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for easier access.
